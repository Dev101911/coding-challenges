# Week 10 challenge
​
Write a function `ageMedian` which accepts an array of birthdate strings in format yyyy-MM-dd and a date(same format) on which to calculate the age from.
​
First you need to determine the ages of the birthdates as if today was date from the second parameter. Then you have to return the median age as a number. The returned value is either a whole number(no decimals) or whole number + .5
​
Age in the test cases is calculated with one year being 31557600000 miliseconds.
​
​
Examples:
```
ageMedian(["1979-01-30","2007-02-11","1992-04-23","1992-06-30","2001-06-01","2002-02-04","2009-03-26","1998-04-19"],"2011-01-12"]) // returns 10.5
ageMedian(["1975-12-22","1975-02-14","1985-01-26"],"1987-12-18") // returns 11
ageMedian(["1978-01-10","1979-11-04","1976-08-27","1975-03-01","1972-10-16","1970-10-22","1971-02-06","1973-03-27","1974-04-30"],"1982-12-29") // returns 8
ageMedian(["1990-01-01"],"2022-01-01") // returns 32
```
