# Week 26 challenge

With this week's challenge you need to create `permutateMe` function, which takes in a string and returns all possible permutations of its' characters;
There should be no duplicates.

Since the permutation count grows exponentially, the string will not be longer than 7 characters.

*Note: The order of the permutations does not matter.
If the connect portal gives you an error based on it, please use the google form for that solution.*

Examples:
```
permutateMe('ab') // returns ["ab", "ba"]
permutateMe('abc') // returns ["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]
permutateMe('aac') // returns ["aac", "aca", "caa"]
```
