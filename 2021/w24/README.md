# Week 24 challenge

Write a function `findBase` which will receive 3 numbers as arguments - `num1`, `num2` and `product`. However, the base of the numbers is not known, so they will be encoded as strings.

The relationship between the numbers is that `num1` times `num2` equals `product`. Your task is to find the lowest possible base in which these numbers were encoded so that relationship would hold true.

Examples:
```
findBase('10', '11', '110') // returns 2
findBase('10', '10', '100') // returns 2
findBase('22', '1', '22') // returns 3
findBase('2', '3', '12') // returns 4
findBase('12', '5', '60') // returns 10
findBase('4', '17', '68') // returns 10
findBase('e', '2', '1c') // returns 16
```
