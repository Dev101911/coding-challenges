# Week 15 challenge

Write a function `simplify` which accepts an array of ascending numbers and returns a string. The returned list is a comma seperated list. If it includes more than 2 consecutive numbers, those are reduced to a range.

Examples:
```
simplify([1,2,3,4,5]) // returns '1-5'
simplify([-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]) // returns '-2-5'
simplify([1,2,4,5,6]) // returns '1,2,4-6'
simplify([-7,-4,-3,-2,0,7,9,15,16,17,18,19,22]) // returns '-7,-4--2,0,7,9,15-19,22'
```
