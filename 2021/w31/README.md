# Week 31 challenge

Write a function `thatsEnough` that takes in an array as the first argument and limit `N` as 2nd.
The returned array should limit the occurrence of each item in the array to max `N` times.
The order of items should be preserved.

**Note:** The input array shouldn't be mutated.


Examples:
```
thatsEnough([5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 7], 2) // [5, 5, 1, 1, 7]
thatsEnough([5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 7], 1) // [5, 1, 7]
```
