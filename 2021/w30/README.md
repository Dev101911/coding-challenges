# Week 30 challenge

Write a function `findMeDeep` which takes in an array as first argument (haystack) and needle as second and returns wether the needle is found within the haystack.
The caveat is that the haystack typically is nested (multidimensional).

Examples:
```
findMeDeep([1, 2, 3], 2) // returns true
findMeDeep([1, 2, 3], 7) // returns false
findMeDeep([1, 2, 3, [4], [5, [6, 7]]], 7) // returns true
```
