# Week 42 challenge

Write a function `add` which takes in two numbers (as strings) and returns the sum, also as a string.
You might want to recall [how](https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Large-Numbers) we did it in school on the blackboard :)

*Note:* Using `BigInt` for this challenge is forbidden.

Examples:
```
add('1', '1') // returns '2'
add('9999', '9999') // returns '19998'
add('81489141787297148918947891489148971', '8417894917984718949817471897441') // returns '81497559682215133637897708961046412'
```
