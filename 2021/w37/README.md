# Week 37 challenge

Write a function `wouldEuclidBeHappy` which takes in 3 numbers as arguments. The numbers each represent length of 3 sides of a triangle.
It should return `true` if a valid triangle can be constructed with these sides. Otherwise `false`.


Examples:
```
wouldEuclidBeHappy(1, 2, 2) // true
wouldEuclidBeHappy(8, 3, 3) // false
wouldEuclidBeHappy(3, 4, 5) // true
wouldEuclidBeHappy(9, 9, 9) // true
wouldEuclidBeHappy(9, 9, 1) // true
wouldEuclidBeHappy(1, 5, 1) // false
```
